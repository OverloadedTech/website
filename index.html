            <h1>Luca Zani</h1>
            <p><span id="age"></span> y/o developer from Bolzano, Italy, also known online as <strong>OverloadedTech</strong>. I write code, solder, do some 3D printing, investing, and whatever else catches my attention; I don't define myself as &quot;special&quot; my interests feel special to me but they're normal like anyone else's.</p>
            <p>I mainly focus on backend work, but I'm discovering frontend programming for some projects and I'm actually liking it.</p>
            <p class="small">(yes, the age is auto updated)</p>

            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>I don't contribute much to open source anymore, sadly :(</p>
            <p>Most of my work these days is on private repos: school projects, stuff for other places I'm involved with. The public repos you see on my GitHub are mostly older experiments or utilities I built while learning.</p>
            <p>I plan to come back and help with FOSS as soon as I find some projects that interest me and I have a bit of free time.</p>

            <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
            <p>Currently focused on backend stuff: APIs, databases, system architecture. I like building things that actually work and solving problems that matter.</p>
            <p>I'm also working on some new projects that I'll talk about as soon as I can, once they become more mature and ready to show.</p>
            
            <h3>Empty Character</h3>
            <p>A basic empty character app I wrote when I was 13. Nothing too special, nothing too big, and I probably overthought it a bit. It's available on its <a href="https://emptycharacterapp.web.app/" target="_blank">dedicated site</a> and on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.empty.character" target="_blank">Play Store</a>.</p>
            <p>The project is open and free. Due to its basic nature, it's maintained by me but hasn't been updated in a while.</p>
